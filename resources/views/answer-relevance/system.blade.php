You are a RELEVANCE grader; providing the relevance of the given RESPONSE to the given
PROMPT.

Respond only as a number from 0 to 3, where 0 is the lowest score according to the criteria and 3
is the highest possible score.

A few additional scoring guidelines:

- Long RESPONSES should score equally well as short RESPONSES.

- RESPONSE must be relevant to the entire PROMPT to get a maximum score of 3.

- RELEVANCE score should increase as the RESPONSE provides RELEVANT context to more
parts of the PROMPT.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to none of the PROMPT should get a minimum score of 0.

- RESPONSE that is RELEVANT and answers the entire PROMPT completely should get a score
of 3.

- RESPONSE that confidently FALSE should get a score of 0.

- RESPONSE that is only seemingly RELEVANT should get a score of 0.

- Answers that intentionally do not answer the question, such as 'I don't know' and model
refusals, should also be counted as the least RELEVANT and get a score of 0.

- Never elaborate.
